# The `.gitignore` file :

- Create a `.gitignore` file and add content to it that _shouldn't_ be tracked by **Git** or _shouldn't_ be pushed to **GitHub** (here, `env/`, `.vscode/`, and `.env`)
- Supports wildcards & glob patterns (need to experiment)
- Use templates (VSCode `gitignore` extension & the website)
